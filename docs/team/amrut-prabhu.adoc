== PROJECT: Club Connect

---

== Overview

*Club Connect* is an application targeted at <<DeveloperGuide#club,club>> <<DeveloperGuide#member,members>> who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.

*Club Connect* is an application that a user who loves to type would fancy - in other words, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI).
All output is displayed on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) - which is just computer jargon for a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes.

=== Justification

Members of a club have certain responsibilities and must carry out tasks to fulfil their responsibilities. Furthermore, `EXCO` members can delegate tasks to other members which they must perform within a stipulated time period.
Maintaining a record of tasks is crucial as it help maintain transparency and accountability of the club.

=== Minor Enhancement Added: Profile Photo Feature

==== External Behaviour

---
#Start of Extract (from User Guide)#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=changepic]

#End of Extract (from User Guide)#

---

==== Justification
Most student clubs have a large number of members.
Hence, members may find it difficult to identify other members based solely on name.
Having the ability to add a profile photo for yourself would make it much easier for others to identify you if they ever need to get in contact with you.

=== Other Enhancement Added: Delete Tag Command

==== External Behaviour

---
#Start of Extract (from User Guide)#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletetag]

#End of Extract (from User Guide)#

---

==== Justification

---
If a tag in Club Connect is no longer required, an `Exco` member can delete the tag from all members.

Here is an example of when this feature can be useful.
Suppose the club is conducting a fundraising event.
Then, all members who are organising and helping out in this event can be tagged with `Fundraising` in Club Connect.
Once the fundraising event is over, it does not make sense to have this tag anymore.
So, the `deletetag` command allows any `Exco` member to remove this tag from all members (and from Club Connect itself) in one go.

=== Other Enhancement Added: UI Look and Feel

==== External Behaviour

---
Before this enhancement was added, the Club Connect UI looked like the one shown in the image below (Figure 1).

_Figure 1. The old Club Connect UI_

This enhancement changed the Club Connect UI to have a cleaner and more modern look.
This new UI look is shown in Figure 2 below.

---

==== Justification

---
Changing the UI of the Club Connect application to look cleaner and feel more modern would make the application more appealing to users.
Especially in the case of university students (who are effectively our target audience),
an aesthetically pleasing UI would encourage them to adopt our application for their club management needs.
