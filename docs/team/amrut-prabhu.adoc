== PROJECT: Club Connect

== 1. Overview

*Club Connect* is an application targeted at <<DeveloperGuide#club,club>> <<DeveloperGuide#member,members>> who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.

*Club Connect* is an application that a user who loves to type would fancy - in other words, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI).
All output is displayed on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) - which is just computer jargon for a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes.

== 2. About this portfolio

This project portfolio documents my contributions to the Club Connect project.
It includes a summary of features that I implemented, other ways in which I contributed to the project,
and extracts of my documentation in the Club Connect User Guide and Developer Guide.

== 3. Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: This enhancement added functionality to *manage information of club members*.
** What it does: The import feature adds all members in a specified CSV (comma separated values) file to Club Connect.
                Conversely, the export feature makes it possible to add the details of all members in Club Connect to a CSV file.
** Justification: During recruitment events (such as the annual Student Life Fair at the National University of Singapore),
                  club representatives collect data of prospective members using software like Microsoft Excel.
                  They will then have to update Club Connect's database to include the data of the inducted members.
                  The `import` command allows Executive Committee (Exco) members to add all these new members in one go. +
                   +
                  For club administration tasks where you need to get a list of all members of the club and their details
                  (signing up all members to NUSync, for example), the `export` command comes in handy.
                  It generates a file containing all the relevant information in a user friendly form.
                  This information can then be easily managed and modified outside the application.
** Highlights: This enhancement is an end-to-end feature and makes use of almost all components of the software, from `Commons` to `Storage`.
                Though the implementation of these features is intuitive and makes use of existing code wherever possible,
                it was challenging as it required the creation of a CsvUtil class (to handle parsing) from scratch.
                It is also made robust in order to prevent frustration in users.
** Relevant pull requests:

* *Minor enhancement*: This enhancement added support for a profile photos for each member.
** What it does: allows the currently logged in member to change their profile photo.
                Similarly, they can choose to remove their profile photo as well.
** Justification: Since most student clubs have a large number of members, members may find it difficult to identify others by name alone.
                  Having the ability to add a profile photo for yourself makes it much easier for others to identify you when they need to contact you.
** Highlights: This enhancement is an end-to-end feature and makes use of all components of the software, from `Commons` to `Ui`.
                It was challenging as the feature had to handle the image files efficiently, and had to allow the application to remain portable.

=== Major Enhancement Added: Data Handling

#End of Extract (from UserGuide)#

=====Export Members

#End of Extract (from UserGuide)#

=== Justification

During recruitment events (such as the annual Student Life Fair at the National University of Singapore),
club representatives collect data of incoming members on software such as Microsoft Excel.
They will then have to update Club Connect's database to include the data of these new members.
One way od doing so would be by adding all the new members one at a time, by using the `add` command.
But, this is extremely cumbersome.
The `import` command allows the `Exco` members to add all these new members in one go.

=== Minor Enhancement Added: Profile Photo Feature

==== External Behaviour

---
#Start of Extract (from User Guide)#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=changepic]

#End of Extract (from User Guide)#

---

==== Justification
Most student clubs have a large number of members.
Hence, members may find it difficult to identify other members based solely on name.
Having the ability to add a profile photo for yourself would make it much easier for others to identify you if they ever need to get in contact with you.

=== Other Enhancement Added: Delete Tag Command

==== External Behaviour

---
#Start of Extract (from User Guide)#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletetag]

#End of Extract (from User Guide)#

---

==== Justification

---
If a tag in Club Connect is no longer required, an `Exco` member can delete the tag from all members.

Here is an example of when this feature can be useful.
Suppose the club is conducting a fundraising event.
Then, all members who are organising and helping out in this event can be tagged with `Fundraising` in Club Connect.
Once the fundraising event is over, it does not make sense to have this tag anymore.
So, the `deletetag` command allows any `Exco` member to remove this tag from all members (and from Club Connect itself) in one go.

=== Other Enhancement Added: UI Look and Feel

==== External Behaviour

---
Before this enhancement was added, the Club Connect UI looked like the one shown in the image below (Figure 1).

image::Old_Ui.png[width="550"]
_Figure 1. The old Club Connect UI_

This enhancement changed the Club Connect UI to have a cleaner and more modern look.
This new UI look is shown in Figure 2 below.

image::Ui.png[width="700"]
_Figure 2. The enhanced Club Connect UI_

---

==== Justification

---
Changing the UI of the Club Connect application to look cleaner and feel more modern would make the application more appealing to users.
Especially in the case of university students (who are effectively our target audience),
an aesthetically pleasing UI would encourage them to adopt our application for their club management needs.
