== PROJECT: Club Connect

---

== Overview

*Club Connect* is an application targeted at <<DeveloperGuide#club,club>> <<DeveloperGuide#member,members>> who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.

*Club Connect* is an application that a user who loves to type would fancy - in other words, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI). All output is displayed on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) - which is just computer jargon for a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes.

*Code Contributed* : [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/blob/master/collated/functional/yash-chowdhary.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/blob/master/collated/test/yash-chowdhary.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Remove Group Command

==== External Behavior

---
#Start of Extract (from User Guide)#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=removegroup]

#End of Extract (from User Guide)#

---

==== Justification

---
If a sub-committee of a club is no longer required, the `Exco` members can delete the group from the app.
This changes the group of all the members (previously part of the deleted group) to the default group - `Member`.

Whether it is for general communication or for club-related events, the ability to email members is essential to the smooth functioning of an organization.

=== Justification

Members of a club have certain responsibilities and must carry out tasks to fulfil their responsibilities. Furthermore, `EXCO` members can delegate tasks to other members which they must perform within a stipulated time period.
Maintaining a record of tasks is crucial as it help maintain transparency and accountability of the club.

== Project: NUS Sports Update

=== Overview
The main source of motivation behind this project is the lack of real time organized information regarding sports events on campus â€“ fixtures, timings, and (most importantly) results, unless you know somebody on the team or unless you yourself are a part of the team. The app also seeks to eliminate the use of Google forms and other unofficial means of signing up and indication of interest, that may be easily missed by a significant number of students. This application seeks to take care of these problems and mainly caters to the needs of NUS students. The user-friendliness of the app makes the job of the organizers simpler by providing organized access to all information. Live-scores and fixtures help engage more students in the sports events around campus, and improve the reach of these events.
