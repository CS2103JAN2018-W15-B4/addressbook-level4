* EXCOntact is a desktop application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* EXCOntact is targeted to Student Organizations like clubs and societies characterized by a
well-established hierarchy.
* Student Organizations require a one-stop destination for all their managerial needs when it comes to
enrollment, delegating tasks, preparing for events, and opening polls and feedback systems.
* Student organizations can have hundreds of members which are further divided into sub-committees that have
narrower focuses. These subcommittee members are often assigned individual tasks. With time, it will get very difficult to keep
track of everything.
* EXCOntact is the solution to this problem as it aims to help organizations organize better.
